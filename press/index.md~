# Your Screen Time Up!  
### Announcing Version 2 of Screen Time for iOS ###

June 5, 2014

BabyBinks is proud to announce the latest release of their screen time management application.  Screen Time is a simple app that allows you to set limits on the amount of time you children use an iPhone or iPad. Set a time length, press start and pass it to you children. After the time expires, a series of notifications discourages your children from using the device until you enter the correct passcode.

Parents, educators and health professionals are concerned about the length of
time that children are exposed to electronic devices. However, the 
recreational and educational potential of the iPhone and iPad make it a favorite
of both parents and children. Screen Time is a simple solution to help set and manage limits to your children's interaction with an iOS device.  A fixture in the App Store since 2011, Screen Time has been featured by Apple for its innovative approach to helping parents address important concerns regarding children's use of mobile computing device.  

This version 2.0 release brings important features to the application that extend its features and improve usability.  Most notably, Screen Time now takes advantage of Apple's iCloud services, allowing usage data to be synced between devices.  Enhanced reporting features identify the device used for each screen time session.   Using Notification Center, Screen Time now sends a notification to all devices that share an iCloud account _including iMacs, MacBooks and MacPros_.  Parents will be notified on any devices when a child's screen time is up on another device.  In additions, the interface has been updated for iOS7 and optimized for larger iPhone screen sizes.

Screen Time has been rigorously tested by a panel of young students and their parents.  The students unanimously agree, "We hate it!".  Parents unanimously agree, "We love it!"



### About BabyBinks ###
BabyBinks is a creator of educational and family-friendly application for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It was founded 2009 by a dad who couldn't find a decent baby naming iPhone app and set out to make one (remember this was 2009).  There are currently 9,292 baby name apps in the App Store. Unfortunately, the app was finished 3 months after the birth of his second child. Subsequently, his son was named the old fashioned way...by letting his 3 year old sister pick the name. She was watching Sesame Street at the time, so his name is Oscar.  

Since then, BabyBinks has created a catalog of apps, each having the distinction of being featured by Apple. This include a feature on the front page on iTunes.
